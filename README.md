# rpi-wifi-jammer
Build your own wifi-jammer with raspberry pi!

# Materials

- [ ] Raspberry Pi (any model of the 1, 2, or 3 should work), I used a 1.
- [ ] Ethernet (wired) connection for the Pi to use
- [ ] Cheap USB Wifi dongle. I used [this](http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-wifi.html).

# Instructions

1. Install [Arch Linux for ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms) on an SD card
    
    Choose your Raspberry Pi model from the list and follow the provided instructions. I believe you will need a Linux or Mac computer to do this. **I promise this is the hardest step**.
